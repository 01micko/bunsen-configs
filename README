bunsen-configs
==============

This package holds configuration files and scripts that are featured
on a Bunsen Labs installation. Some of them have been inherited from
CrunchBang Linux by Philip Newborough.

The main content is:

*) A collection of user configuration files templates,
stored in /usr/share/bunsen/skel, and a user setup script to install them,
triggered from the Xsession login.

*) Configuration for lightdm, including a workaround for language selection.

*) Default mimetype configuration.

*) There are four new groups added to debian alternatives:
  bl-file-manager
  bl-image-viewer
  bl-media-player
  bl-text-editor
along with corresponding .desktop files and a mimeapps.list.
These enable users to have more flexibility in their choice of default applications
without having to edit menus, scripts or keyboard shortcuts.

*) Wrapper scripts for mpv, gvim and edit.

This package also adds some other small system configuration files.
