bunsen-configs
==============

This package holds configuration files and scripts that are featured
on a Bunsen Labs installation. Many of them have been inherited from
CrunchBang Linux by Philip Newborough.

Please note that these merely represent (what we consider to be) sane defaults,
so please do not make any pull request that simply changes things 
to your personal preference. 
If, however, you deem something is wrong you are of course free to raise an
issue and discuss this.

The main content is a collection of user configuration files templates,
stored in /usr/share/bunsen/skel

There are also four new groups added to debian alternatives:
	bl-file-manager
	bl-image-viewer
	bl-media-player
	bl-text-editor
along with corresponding .desktop files and a mimeapps.list.
These enable users to have more flexibility in their choice of default applications
without having to edit menus, scripts or keyboard shortcuts.

This package also adds some other small system configuration files.
