bunsen-configs
==============

This package holds configuration files and scripts that are featured
on a Bunsen Labs installation. Some of them have been inherited from
CrunchBang Linux by Philip Newborough.

The main content is:

*) A collection of user configuration files templates,
stored in /usr/share/bunsen/skel

*) Configuration for lightdm, including a workaround for language selection.

*) Default mimetype configuration.

*) There are four new groups added to debian alternatives:
  bl-file-manager
  bl-image-viewer
  bl-media-player
  bl-text-editor
along with corresponding .desktop files and a mimeapps.list.
These enable users to have more flexibility in their choice of default applications
without having to edit menus, scripts or keyboard shortcuts.

This package also adds some other small system configuration files.
