.TH "BUNSENLABS-SESSION" "1"
.SH "NAME"
bunsenlabs-session \(em Starts a BunsenLabs session.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-session\fR runs a BunsenLabs session, calling openbox and
starting the necessary auxiliary applications.
There is no full session manager, so you will not be able
to save your state from one log in to the next.
Although openbox is the default BunsenLabs window manager,
users can select others while continuing to use the BunsenLabs
menu, keyboard shortcuts and autostarted applications (see below).
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-session\fR does not take any command line
arguments.
.PP
On log in, \fBbunsenlabs-session\fR will run the
~/.config/bunsen/autostart script if it exists, and will copy in the
default file from /usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart otherwise. You may
place anything you want to run automatically in this file, for example:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
xset -b off
clipit &
.fi
.RE
.PP
Make sure that each command that does not return quickly is followed by a "&" or else the script will
stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the
/usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart file as an example for creating your
own.
.PP
\fBWindow Manager:\fR users can choose another window manager than the
default openbox by editing the line:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
window_manager=openbox
.fi
.RE
.PP
near the top of ~/.config/bunsen/autostart. In such cases they will
probably want to adjust the autostarted applications, likely with a
new "case" clause for the new window manager. (See autostart for examples.)

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
bl-xdg-autostart(1), openbox(1), jgmenu(1), xbindkeys(1).
