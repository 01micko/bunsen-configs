## Bunsenlabs User config files
## All default BunsenLabs user config files are located in /usr/share/bunsen/skel.
## The script bl-user-setup copies them to the user $HOME directory on first login.
## See more info with command 'bl-user-setup --help'

## BunsenLabs autostart
## ====================
## When you login to your BunsenLabs session, this autostart script
## will be executed to launch any applications
## you want to run at startup.
##
## NB, like openbox's and labwc's autostart script, this uses the default shell,
## so "bashisms" are not supported.
##
## (Environment variables are set in ~/.config/bunsen/environment.)
##
## Note: some programs, such as 'nm-applet' are run via XDG autostart,
## from .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart.
## To disable this, comment out the last line in this file:
## "bl-xdg-autostart"
##
## Run 'bl-xdg-autostart --list' to list any XDG autostarted programs.
##
## If you do something cool with your autostart script and you think others
## could benefit from your hack, please consider sharing it at:
## http://forums.bunsenlabs.org (registration required)

## NOTE: if you are using X11 you should not be running this file,
## so edit 'autostart' instead.

## WINDOW MANAGER
## Do not edit the next line unless you have also installed any
## necessary other programs for the different window manager,
## and edited the window-manager-dependent section later in this file.
## Use the window manager's actual command, not name.
## This should be the first uncommented line in this file:
## NOTE: if you are using wayland you don't need to reset this if using 'labwc'
## however can be changed to some other compositor like sway, hyprland, river etc
window_manager=labwc

# test if chosen window manager is actually running (you should probably not edit this line)
#if [ -z "$WAYLAND_DISPLAY" ]; then
#    pgrep -x -u "$USER" "$window_manager" || { echo "$0: Window manager $window_manager is not running." >&2 ; exit 1;}
#fi

### SETTINGS START

# start keybinds daemon
# (If this clashes with some window manager's keybinds,
# you can move it to the window-manager-dependent section below.)
#xbindkeys_autostart

## Turn on/off system beep.
#xset b off

### SETTINGS END

## PolicyKit authentication
hash lxpolkit 2>/dev/null && lxpolkit &

## Volume control for systray
#pnmixer &

## Start Clipboard manager
# wayland clipboard can be started by compositor

## Start Thunar Daemon, if set as bl-file-manager
if [ "$(readlink -f "$(which bl-file-manager)")" = "$(which thunar)" ]
then
    thunar --daemon &
fi

## bl-welcome - post-installation script, will not run in a live session
## and only runs once. Safe to remove.
## Not provided in base install.
#(sleep 10; bl-welcome --firstrun) &

## bl-fortune - have the system come up with a little adage
## These quotes are from the #! and BL forums.
## Many of them are from the 'Off Topic' subforums of those sites,
## so they are likely to be abstract, out-of-context...
## ... and possibly Not Safe For Work, children, or your mental health in general.
## Uncomment the following line to enable this (adjust the sleep seconds to taste).
#(sleep 20; bl-fortune) &

## Run the XDG autostart stuff. This requires python3-xdg to be installed.
## See 'bl-xdg-autostart --list' for list of autostarted applications.
