/* This is the user default calendar file, used if calendar(1)
 * is invoked by a user with a ~/.calendar/calendar file.
 *
 * In the standard setup, we simply include the default calendar
 * definitions from /usr/share/calendar/calendar.all.
 * If you want only some of those definitions, 
 * change the "include" lines in this file.
 * That way, your changes will be kept next time you upgrade.
 *
 * The search path for include files is:
 *   ~/.calendar
 *   /etc/calendar
 *   /usr/share/calendar
